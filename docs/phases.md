# Vaultic — Development Phases

Overview of each development phase, its scope, and current status.
For the detailed architectural specification, see the project's internal documentation.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

Establishes the project skeleton and architectural boundaries.

- **Hexagonal architecture** scaffolded: `core/` (domain), `adapters/` (implementations), `cli/` (presentation), `config/`
- **Domain layer** defined: models, traits (ports), service signatures, and typed error handling
- **CLI parsing** with clap: all 10 commands registered with global flags (`--cipher`, `--env`, `--verbose`)
- **CI/CD pipelines** configured: format + lint + test on three platforms; release workflow for binaries and crates.io
- **Project metadata**: README with badges, AGPL-3.0 license, `.gitignore`

---

## Phase 2 — Encryption 🔲

Implements the core encryption engine with dual backend support.

- **Age backend** (`AgeBackend`): encrypt/decrypt using X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **GPG backend** (`GpgBackend`): encrypt/decrypt using system GPG keyring
- **Strategy pattern** operational: select backend via `--cipher age|gpg` flag
- **Key management**: `vaultic keys add`, `keys list`, `keys remove` — manage authorized recipients
- **`vaultic init`** creates `.vaultic/` directory structure with `config.toml` and `recipients.txt`

---

## Phase 3 — Diff and Check 🔲

Adds variable detection and file comparison capabilities.

- **Dotenv parser** (`DotenvParser`): parse and serialize `.env` files preserving comments and order
- **Check command**: compare local `.env` against `.env.template` — report missing, extra, and empty variables
- **Diff command**: compare two secret files showing added, removed, and modified keys
- **Colored output**: formatted tables and status indicators for diff/check results
- **Integration tests** for all comparison scenarios

---

## Phase 4 — Multi-environment and Inheritance 🔲

Enables layered environment management with smart resolution.

- **Environment resolver** (`EnvResolver`): merge `base.env` + `{env}.env` with override semantics
- **Config-driven environments**: read environment definitions and inheritance chains from `config.toml`
- **`vaultic resolve --env <env>`**: generate the final merged file for a given environment
- **Cross-environment diff**: `vaultic diff --env dev --env prod` compares resolved outputs
- **Circular inheritance detection**: error with clear diagnostic when cycles are found

---

## Phase 5 — Audit and Polish 🔲

Completes the feature set with audit logging, status reporting, and UX polish.

- **Audit logger** (`JsonAuditLogger`): record every operation as JSON lines in `.vaultic/audit.log`
- **`vaultic log`** with filters: `--author`, `--since`, `--last N`
- **`vaultic status`**: full project overview — keys, environments, sync state, variable counts
- **Git pre-commit hook**: `vaultic hook install` — blocks plaintext secrets from being committed
- **Descriptive error messages**: every error includes cause, context, and suggested next step
