## Dual Licensing Model

Vaultic is available under two licensing options:

### 1. Open Source — AGPLv3

The [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE) allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute Vaultic, provided that:

- Any modifications you make are also released under AGPLv3
- If you run a modified version as a network service, you must provide the source code to your users
- All derivative works remain open source under the same terms

**The AGPLv3 is sufficient if you:**

- Use Vaultic internally within your team as-is (no modifications)
- Contribute your modifications back to the open source project
- Build open source tools that integrate with Vaultic

### 2. Commercial License

The commercial license removes the copyleft obligations of AGPLv3.

**You need a commercial license if you:**

- Embed or integrate Vaultic into proprietary software or services
- Modify Vaultic and cannot release the modifications as open source
- Offer Vaultic as part of a commercial SaaS, PaaS, or managed service
- Require specific support terms, SLAs, or indemnification

## What the Commercial License Includes

- Permission to use, modify, and distribute Vaultic without AGPLv3 obligations
- Freedom to keep modifications and integrations proprietary
- Priority support and direct communication with the development team
- Custom terms tailored to your organization's needs

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use Vaultic for free in my company?**
Yes. Using the open source version as a CLI tool for managing your team's secrets is fully permitted under AGPLv3. No commercial license is needed for this use case.

**Do I need a commercial license just to use Vaultic internally?**
No. If you use Vaultic as-is (without modifications) or contribute any modifications back to the project, the AGPLv3 covers your usage.

**What if I build a product that uses Vaultic?**
If your product includes or distributes Vaultic (or a modified version), and you cannot release it under AGPLv3, then you need a commercial license.

**Can I evaluate Vaultic before purchasing?**
Absolutely. The open source version is fully functional. Evaluate it under AGPLv3 and reach out when you need commercial terms.
